REPORT(SlideShow):

First few steps were easy, which was setting up the 
HTML structure according to the lab sheet. CSS sytle
took me a second to understand how it was affecting each of my div tags but after a little research and going through slide, i got it. JavaScript looked very difficult at first, i wasnt sure how the slideShow was supposed to work or look like. Upon several failed attempts of code, i sat down and thought about the process thorougly step by step, then implemented each step one by one. First i added the basic code where only the first slide was visible and rest hidden, then I implemented a function which allows 'next' and 'prev' buttons to move between pictures, And finally the code to handle scenarios where slidshow reaches the first or the last slide.

This is a read me file
